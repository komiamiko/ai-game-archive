# Example bots

These are example bots for ShipTurret.
The goals of these are:

* Testing the game functionality
* Being instructive examples for writing more complex bots
* Being weak opponents to test better bots against

They are written in Python for simplicity.
The simpler ones are also to some degree ignorant of actual game constants.
