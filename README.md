Tournaments in simple games with bot players.

I'm by no means the first to host a tournament like this.
There are plenty such tournaments you can participate in online.
The goal of this to me was to have fun and provide a laid back environment for my friends to try this kind of game.

Past tournaments are published here for the public to learn from.

## Common rules

* Don't spam my submissions box with too many submissions. Send forth your best champions!
* Bots should not take excessively long. I'll add a time limit if necessary.
* No malicious code. I check every submission by hand.
* Bots should not peek at information they're not supposed to have, like hidden game state or other bots' code.
* Bots should not be designed specifically to counter another bot.
* If your bot errors or returns an invalid value, it automatically loses the round.
